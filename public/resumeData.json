    "bio": "I'm hooked on startups. Passionate about sales, technology, and hospitality/travel. I love building things - companies, teams, processes, websites, apps, pretty much anything out of wood. I enjoy learning new skills and honing existing ones. Personal growth is something I strive for daily, trying my best to live by the 1% rule where you aim to improve/grow just 1% every day. My wife says I'm addicted to self-help ðŸ˜…. I mainly create content around sales, sales operations, go to market strategy, leadership, hospitality, and tourism. Hobbies include traveling, woodworking, chess, golf, gardening, and reef-keeping (I keep several saltwater aquariums) to name a few.",

Reasons may include lack of runway/capital, product-market fit, competition, lack of research, ineffective marketing, the team, the business model, a million other reasons or any combination of them. With every new client, my goal is to empower them to take ownership over their systems and processes so that they walk away not only with results, but with skills and a plan to supercharge their next phase of growth."
